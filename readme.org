* Infra Demo

** Installation
- This assumes you have an existing EC2 key pair, a SSH key pair installed on EC2
  and the "default" AWS security group allows inter-instance access.
- clone this repo
- install terraform
  https://terraform.io/downloads.html
- install ansible(1.7.2)
- gem install terraform_inventory (not the best tool, but I need an inventory)
- cp terraform-init.tfvars terraform.tfvars
- edit terraform.tfvars to reflect your existing EC2 account, path to SSH key pair and key name
- cp ansible-init.cfg ansible.cfg
- edit ansible.cfg to point to your existing EC2 SSH private key

** Execution
- From the  harvest-terraform directory, execute "terraform apply". This should build the needed EC2 infra
- Assuming the "terraform apply" was successful,  exec
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  tinventory --map=aws_instance.fe01:webservers aws_instance.app01:appservers aws_instance.app02:appservers aws_instance.monitoring01:monitoring  ./provision/inventory.yml
#+END_SRC
  This will build a ansible usable inventory from the terraform state file. If it complains of a existing/conflicting
  inventory.yml, overwrite with a "y"
- Next configure hosts with
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ansible-playbook  -i provision/inventory.yml provision/site.yml
#+END_SRC

** Cleanup
  - To shutdown all hosts.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   terraform destroy
#+END_SRC
