* Installation
- This assumes you have an existing EC2 key pair, and a SSH key pair installed on EC2
- install terraform
- install ansible(1.7.2)
- gem install terraform_inventory (not the best tool, but it's quick)
- cp terraform-init.tfvars terraform.tfvars
- edit terraform.tfvars to reflect your existing EC2 account, path to SSH key pair and key name
- cp ansible-init.cfg ansible.cfg
- edit ansible.cfg to point to your existing EC2 SSH private key

* Execution
- From the  harvest-terraform directory, execute "terraform apply". This should build the needed EC2 infra
- Assuming the "terraform apply" was successful,  exec
  "tinventory --map=aws_instance.fe01:webservers aws_instance.app01:appservers aws_instance.app02:appservers  ./provision/inventory.yml"
  This will build a ansible usable inventory from the terraform state file.
